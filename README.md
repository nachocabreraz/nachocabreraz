# Hello World! I'm Hernan Cabrera 👋 

I’m a a Full Stack Developer and Lawyer, with experience developing embedded software and also developing both Front-End and Back-End applications.⁣

As a lawyer, I've developed a critical analytical thinking. When I first started learning about programming, I've been able to apply that type of thinking when it comes to solve different problems that I encounter in the daily routine as a programmer.
Always looking to improve my skills and learn new technologies, as well as work with people that'll help me grow as a professional and as a human.


### My Stack:
- Javascript, Ruby
- React, Redux, Node, Express
